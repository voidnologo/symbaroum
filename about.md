# Symbaroum

The intimate, richly nuanced Symbaroum setting revolves around the Ambrians â€“ a civilization that
two decades ago were forced to flee their ancestral soil after a devastating war. Their new and
promised land borders on the vast forest of Davokar, covering the remnants of the Empire of Symbaroum
which fell into ruin hundreds of years ago. Brimming with natural resources and mythical treasures,
the forest calls out to the Ambrians to be explored and exploited, but the road into its depths lays
far from open. Not only are the shadowy halls beneath the foliage fraught with danger, monsters and
infectious corruption; there are also the elves of the Iron Pact who have vowed to die to keep anyone
from disturbing the ruins of old, warning that the ancient evil of Symbaroum stirs in its sleep.

The horrors of Davokar are about to awaken.
