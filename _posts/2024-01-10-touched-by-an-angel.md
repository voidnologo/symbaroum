The morning after our rat heist, we finish packing our things and make our final
preparations before our journey. The world is blanketed in a fresh layer of
snow, and small flurries spin lazily through the air. The sky is otherwise
clear, and it seems like it will be good weather for travelling.

When we meet in the lobby of the inn, Igni's cheeks redden as he mutters, "I,
uh, I have a breakfast date with Alessina, I'll meet you guys in a bit if
that works?"

"Tell Alessina we say hi!" Aticus calls, but I'm already pushing him out the
door.

---

"I'm just saying, this would all go a lot faster if you all got horses."

I turn from the fur-lined cloaks I'm inspecting to raise my eyebrows at Aticus.
"I don't want a horse. I happen to remember an incident with your horse and the
wall of Vearra's Outpost. That was enough to make me swear off the creatures
forever."

"It all worked out just fine, we got him down!"

Coriol doesn't offer his opinion, but I can hear him chuckling.

At that moment, I hear a familiar clanking of armor and turn to see Flare and
Igni making their way towards us through the meager crowds. Flare doesn't
technically have a face, but it's impossible for him to hide what would be a
grin, and I assume his merriment has something to do with Igni's flaming
cheeks. An excellent breakfast date with Alessina then.

"I'm ready to go when you are," Igni offers when they've reached us. "I
picked up my rations and things on the way here."

"Off to the inn then," I say, barely resisting the urge to ruffle his hair.

I am pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to find Prior Matais. As we walk
into the lobby of the Day's Dawning Inn, we discover a pale man wearing a
priest's medallion lounging in a chair, reading a book. Another man and a
woman sit at a table nearby, him reading in a book, her writing in one. They
all look up from their work as we walk in and, seeing my Theurg robes, adopt
expectant expressions.

I smile at the man in the chair. "Are you Prior Matais?"

He puts his book down and heaves a sigh of relief. "Sister Agathara?"

I take a couple steps closer, extending my hand to him. "Yes, I'm Sister
Agathara. It's so nice to meet you." I introduce him to the rest of my party;
his eyebrows raise a little when I get to Flare.

"I am truly delighted to meet you all," he says and beckons to his companions.
"I am pleased to introduce you to Sister Synthia and Liturg Borio." Everyone
shakes everyone's hands, and Prior Matais continues, "I trust you got the
message from our _joint friend_. We have need to reach Ravenia, and she said she
knew of someone who could help us get there. Travelling in the winter is an
overwhelming thought... but then, travelling in the summer is also an
overwhelming thought! We are grateful for your assistance."

"We are sorry for the delay, we had some small business here in Yndaros that
could not be left undone." To my great relief (and surprise), none of my
comrades offers so much as a snicker. "However, we are now ready to leave as
soon as you wish."

We sit in the surprisingly comfortable common area of the inn for about an hour
while Matais and his people pack their things and prepare to leave. Igni and
Flare, sitting across the room, are surrounded by a lazily rising cloud of
vapor, the snow carried in on their feeting melting quickly from the heat
eminating from Flare. When they return to us, I note immediately the newness
of their gear and the lack of any survival equipment.

As we leave the inn, I can faintly hear Aticus and Igni bickering about horses,
hypothermia, and who would be the best to eat if we got stuck in a blizzard.
Luckily, Prior Matais and his companions are walking ahead of us, pestering
Coriol - easily the one of us who is the least inclined to speak with them -
with questions about the route we'll be taking and all our adventures. I manage
to hush Aticus and Igni before we get to the stalls to pick up a last few
traveling supplies, earning myself a vaguely amused look from Flare.

The road out of Yndaros is peaceful, but by no means deserted. Various
merchants come and go, including the firewood vendors we had seen roaming
throughout the city. The sun is shining, and the air feels warmer as we head out
on our adventure.

---

After a long but uneventful day of travel, we reach our first roadside inn. We
can easily see that Prior Matais, Synthia, and Borio are wiped out. Igni shows
them how to ease their aching feet by packing them with snow, and they go to bed
much relieved.

---

The next morning, the temperature has dropped a bit, the wind has picked up, and
light clouds have covered the sun. I find the priests doing various odd
stretches in the courtyard, apparently hoping to make themselves more limber for
the day of travel ahead. They thank Igni for showing them how to pack snow on
their feet, showing him their quickly healing feet.

The day passes uneventfully, and we reach the next roadside inn without trouble.

---

The next day dawns gloriously. The sun is shining, and the air is noticeably
warmer. We start out on our way with light hearts and smiles on our faces.

As we are climbing a long steep hill that afternoon, we are yanked from our
cheerfulness by the sound of a man screaming in pain. Aticus leaps onto his
horse and rides ahead as Coriol, Igni, Flare, and I form a defensive ring
around Matais and his friends.

There are a few moments of tense silence until Aticus returns. We can see his
frown as soon as he crests the hill.

"There's been an accident up ahead, it looks like a man's horse slipped and fell
on him. I'm going back to help him." Aticus turns his horse around and calls
back over his shoulder, "It doesn't look like a trap to me, but please use
caution and listen for me to call for help."

Mu heart aches at the thought of the trapped and injured man. "I'll go with
you."

"Just in case it's a trap, it might be smarter for you to stay here and for
Flare to come with me instead."

"So you want to take both our strong fighters away from those we're meant to
escort?"

Aticus hesitates. "Well..."

"We could all go together," Igni pipes up. "Then we have our strong fighters and
our healer all together if it _is_ a trap."

We all agree to this and get into a formation with Matais, Synthia, Borio,
and I in the center, Aticus in front on Gibraltar, Igni and Coriol on the left
and right, and Flare bringing up the rear. I do my best to reassure the newly
nervous priests, telling them that we don't see any danger but want to make sure
that they are well protected in the event that we meet any. Sister Synthia's
face hardens into a mask of determination as she pulls a dagger from her robes.

The site of the accident is brutal. A blood trail smears jaggedly across the
road, stretching from where the horse must have slipped and fallen to where
its body now lay, trapping a still man underneath it. As soon as we can all see
the fallen man, Aticus dismounts and runs forward, trying to lift the horse off
him. Even from a distance, I can see that the horse is partially frozen.

I rush forward to offer my aid, arriving just as Aticus is rolling the man over.
Black tears run from the man's eyes and down his cheeks, and he is clearly not
breathing. I kneel beside him to check his pulse and immediately realize three
things. One: this man is _dead_. Two: this blood is _fresh_. Three: this man is
_stiff_.

I look up at Aticus. "How is this possible? This man is stiff as a board, but
we just heard his scream a minute ago, and this blood is fresh."
