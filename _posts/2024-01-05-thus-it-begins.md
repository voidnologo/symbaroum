It's hard to believe it's only been about a week since we came back from the
Sea of Eternity with Elmendra - it feels like it's been more than six months.

The world has been in chaos for a while now. The whole kingdom is still abuzz
with talk of the war being waged by the Blood Daughter's Barbarian army; the
dissolution of the Curia; the Templars' dark faction that worships the
"fallen Prios"; and the growing popularity of the Reformist movement. Everyone
who isn't talking about these recent events is chasing after the throne of
Symbar.

Even in the last week, though, so much has changed. We've changed. The Queen has
raided the Beggar King and restored her rule in that section of the city. The
marshal law instituted after the attempted assassination of the Empress is
still in place, and tensions in the city are running high. Igni has gained
significant respect within Ordo Magicka for defeating Colinin Furia. Our dear
Coriol, both a Changeling _and_ a Barbarian, must go about with covered face
or in the form of another. I can now wear my Theurg robes on the streets without
fear of being attacked, though I do still get wary looks from passersby. We all
grow restless waiting for our next adventure.

And then it comes, in the form of a goblin messenger bearing a scroll sealed
with wax. "Mistress Silvershade," he says with a small bow, "a message for
you." I smile, thank him, give him the customary thaler and cookie, and pretend
not to notice as his goblin friends greet him with glee. We try our best to
look nonchalant as we finish dinner, but we all eat quickly so that we can
escape to our rooms to inspect this unexpected delivery.

When we finally reach my room after diiner, the men watch as I break the
non-descript wax seal. A beautifully flowing script meets my eyes. _My
Dearest Daughter Agathara_.

"It's from Deseba." I blink hard, trying to hide my relief at reading the words
written in her familiar hand. "She has a mission for us."

Her letter is brief, but descriptive. In the ruins of the cathedral remain many
objects of great power. She describes one of them - a red box, one foot long,
ten inches wide, with copper clasps and the insignia of the Rising Sun of Prios
in silver - and gives exact directions to its location.

"She wants us to fetch this item for her and meet the Theurg Mattais at the
Day's Dawning Inn, near the north gate. From there, we are to escort him and
his party to Rivinia." I trace the ornately flourishing _D_ that serves as
the only signature before rolling up the scroll. "What do you all think?"

"The cathedral is under heavy surveillance, we'll need to find a way around
that." I can tell Igni's initial ideas all include fire from the devious
smile playing across his lips.

"That whole section of the city is barricaded and patrolled." Aticus passes his
warhammer from hand to hand effortlessly, as if already imagining all the skulls
he can smash.

"And there are the curfews." Coriol drums his fingers on his thigh, doubtless
picturing the mass squirreling that could be.

I smile. "I'm sure we can figure something out."

The next morning, after a good night's rest and a hearty breakfast, we dress
in our most professional-looking attire and head in the direction of the
cathedral. I'm still not used to the cold here, or the snow that swirls around
us as we weave our way through the masses of bundled-up people. Almost without
realizing, I find myself walking as close to Flare as I can, soaking up the heat
radiating from his armor. We can see the wooden barricades and patrolling guards
as we approach, as well as scattered fires where guards and townsfolk alike
huddle to share the local gossip.

"Hey! Who are you and where are you going?"

We all turn at the sound of the guard's yell. I muster my most winning smile
and lead the party in his direction.

"Good morning, sir. We're with the Royal Sekretorium, we're here seeking
special information for the queen."

The guard examines our badges before giving us a sideways glance. "Let us
just get the captain to verify these badges..." His companion leaves and
returns just moments later with another guard, this one bearing a few more
stripes on his uniform. He leads us through the barricades and into a small
building on the outskirts of the cathedral courtyard that has clearly been
fitted as a temporary outpost. A man in clean black robes sits behind the desk.

"How can I help you this fine morning?" His tone is pleasant enough, but it's
difficult to miss the suspicion in his expression.

I smile as warmly as I can, given the weather. "We're with the Royal
Sekretorium, we're here seeking special information for the queen."

I know we're in trouble when he raises his eyebrows and steeples his fingers in
front of his chin. "How interesting. I am the head archivist for the
Sekretorium, and I don't remember assigning you to this project."

"Oh, we're not here for your project." I've known Igni long enough to know that
the helpful tone of his voice is pure fabrication, but I doubt the archivist can
tell. "We're here on _special_ business." He eyes the guards around us. "If we
can have just a few moments of privacy, we'd be happy to explain."

The archivist dismissed the guards with a wave of his hand. When they've cleared
out and he's sure we're alone, Igni leans forward conspiratorially. "We're
here to find information about the Throne of Symbar."

The archivists face turns red. "Why do you think that this information would
be inside the cathedral? And what exactly do you think you will find that my
team could not?"

"We suspect that the First Father, in his traitorous ways, was hiding
information about the Throne from the queen." Igni inspects his fingernails,
feigning ennui. "We hope to uncover that information for the queen."

"We have full faith that your team will find everything necessary," I add, "but
the information we seek _is_ time sensitive, so we thought we'd come and get it
ourselves."

"And how do I know you're actually working on _special business_ for the
queen?" The head arcivist reminds me of a cat who has cornered a mouse.

The ends of Igni's hair begin to lift as if blown by an invisible breeze. "Well
if you want to be sure, you can, of course, verify this information with her
and delay our time sensitive mission."

The archivist doesn't even hesitate. "I will. You may come back tomorrow, after
I ask the queen about this." He lowers his head to read the scroll spread across
the desk; we don't need a clearer dismissal.

In the safety of our rooms at the inn, Aticus rolls out a blank piece of paper
and starts sketching. "I got a pretty good idea of the defenses while we were
inside. There are active patrols which stop frequently at the fires, which are
spaced about 30 feet apart. The townspeople also use the fires to warm
themselves, which we might be able to use to get in. There are definitely rings
of guards, so if we do infiltrate, we'll have to do it in layers."

"Hopefully it won't come to infiltration," I say with a nervous chuckle. "But
this is great information to have. Thank you."

We spend the rest of the day relaxing, sharpening our weapons, and wondering
what the next day will bring.
