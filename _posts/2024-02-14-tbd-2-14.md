FOLLOWED BIRD TO CREEPY AREA

The door is splintered, as though something has recently broken out of it. We
don't see any movement or hear any sounds from the apparently abandoned
building, but Coriol points out fresh tracks, which suggest that many mounted
people were here recently.

expensive rug, dining table with lace tablecloth, lit candles, four chairs, simple but nice elegant feather bed
near table 3 individuals sprawled on the ground, quite dead, wearing duke's personal colors and insignia

"Are you sure they're dead?" I ask weakly. "I think that one just breathed..." - Agathara

Coriol goes to check body without blood, body is definitely cold
Coriol goes to look at small door, burn mark and arrow head wedged in door

RECORDING STUFF

Looking around basement, I hear voice calling "Hello? Who's there?"

"Hello? Who are you?"

"Who are you? You identify yourself!"

"Are you with that damn Whip of Prios?"

"Are they gone now?"

"Yes, those that could leave."

Dirty, grimy, been crying, gains his composure

"We heard from a dear friend that you were in trouble and we came to help."

Sister Lasadra asked him to meet with her (head of Whip of Prios) with Father Leandro (head of local sun church)
Couldn't refuse to meet with official representative of the Whip of Prios, but they attacked
Arrested Leandro to keep him safe, Whip thinks Duke opposes Curia
Whip kidnapped Leandro, Duke believes they will break Leandro and brand Duke a heretic
Believes Whip is acting without sanction of official Curia
