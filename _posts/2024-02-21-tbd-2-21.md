Made it back to the Duke's residence

"There is no time. Since you guys have proven competent and capable
and are in the thick of things already..."

Algaya appears, Duke knows who she is (explains panic of Leandro's info)

"I was able to follow where they took Leandro. They are about half an hour
out of town, at an old farmhouse. I saw them take him there, I came back as
soon as I was sure that was their destination."
